✅ All critical issues have been fixed!

## What Was Fixed

### 🔴 CRITICAL: Anti-Flood Service Bug (FIXED)
- **File**: `bot/services/antiflood_service.py` line 55
- **Problem**: Used deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` causing time comparison failures
- **Fix**: Replaced with `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` for timezone-aware datetime
- **Impact**: Anti-flood will now properly detect and mute flooding users

### 🟡 HIGH: Content Lock Logging (ENHANCED)
- **Files**: `bot/handlers/message_handlers.py`
- **Enhancement**: Added comprehensive logging to caption and media lock handlers
- **New Logs Include**:
  - 📝 Caption handler entry and lock status checks
  - 📷 Media handler entry and lock status checks
  - ✅ Successful deletions with clear indicators
  - ❌ Failed deletions with warnings
  - Debug logs for skipped messages (private chats, anonymous admins)

## Testing Instructions

To verify the fixes are working:

1. **Test Anti-Flood**:
   - Send 2+ rapid messages in a test group (limit is set to 1)
   - User should be muted after 2nd message
   - Check logs for: `🌊 Anti-flood check` and `Muted user X for flooding`

2. **Test Link Locks**:
   - Send a message with a URL in a group with `lock_links=true`
   - Message should be deleted
   - Check logs for: `🔗 Lock check` and `🔗 Deleted message with link`

3. **Test Media Locks**:
   - Send a photo/video in a group with `lock_media=true`
   - Media should be deleted
   - Check logs for: `📷 Media handler triggered` and `📷 ✅ Deleted media`

## Next Steps
- Monitor `bot.log` for the new logging output
- Test each feature in your Telegram groups
