A **Telegram verification bot** that uses **Mercle's biometric face verification** to authenticate users. Think of it as "Login with Face" for Telegram!

---

## 💡 Top Use Cases (Copy-Paste Ready for Your Boss)

### 1. **🎮 Gaming & Play-to-Earn Bots** ⭐ POPULAR
**Problem:** Bots and fake accounts farm rewards
**Solution:** One verified face = one account
```
Example: Hamster Kombat, Notcoin, Catizen
- User plays mini-game in Telegram
- Before claiming rewards → verify with face
- Prevents multi-accounting and bot abuse
- Fair reward distribution
```
**Market:** 50M+ users in crypto gaming bots

---

### 2. **🪂 Airdrop & Token Distribution** ⭐⭐⭐ HUGE MARKET
**Problem:** Sybil attacks (one person = 1000 wallets)
**Solution:** Proof of personhood via face verification
```
Example: New crypto project launching
- Announces: "Free 100 tokens to verified humans"
- Users join Telegram → /verify with Mercle
- Bot ensures 1 person = 1 claim
- No bots, no farming
```
**Market:** Every new crypto project (1000s per year)

---

### 3. **👥 Private Community Access** ⭐⭐ PREMIUM
**Problem:** Want exclusive groups (no fake accounts)
**Solution:** Gated access via verification
```
Example: Premium trading signals group
- User pays $50/month to join

- One verified person per subscription
- Ensures subscription integrity
```
**Market:** Premium communities, courses, masterminds

---

### 4. **💰 P2P Trading & Escrow** ⭐⭐⭐ HIGH VALUE
**Problem:** Scams in peer-to-peer trading
**Solution:** Verified identity reduces fraud
```
Example: Crypto P2P marketplace bot
- Buyer wants to buy $10k USDT

- Reduces risk of scams by 90%
- Build trust score based on verifications
```
**Market:** All P2P platforms (LocalBitcoins style)

---

### 5. **🗳️ DAO Voting & Governance** ⭐⭐ GROWING
**Problem:** Whale manipulation (1 person = 100 votes)
**Solution:** One human = one vote (sybil-resistant)
```
Example: Community decides project direction
- Proposal: "Should we build feature X?"
- Only verified humans can vote
- Fair democratic governance
- Can't buy extra votes with fake accounts
```
**Market:** 1000s of DAOs need this

---

### 6. **🎫 Event Ticketing & Access** ⭐ NICHE
**Problem:** Ticket scalping, bot buying
**Solution:** Verified purchase limits

```
**Market:** NFT launches, exclusive events

---

### 7. **🏆 Referral & Reward Programs** ⭐⭐ COMMON
**Problem:** Fake referrals (self-referral abuse)
**Solution:** Verified referrals only
```
Example: "Refer 5 friends, get $50"
- Each referred friend must verify face
- Can't create fake accounts to refer yourself
- Real growth, not fake numbers
```
**Market:** Every growth-focused project

---

### 8. **🎓 Educational Platforms & Courses** ⭐ EMERGING
**Problem:** Account sharing (one login for 10 people)
**Solution:** Face verification to access content
```
Example: $500 online course
- Student verifies at login
- Must re-verify to access lessons

```
**Market:** EdTech, online courses

---

### 9. **💳 Financial Services (KYC-lite)** ⭐⭐⭐ REGULATED

**Solution:** Lightweight biometric verification
```
Example: Micro-loan bot
- User applies for $100 loan
- Verify with Mercle (instant)
- Lender knows it's a unique human
- Not full KYC but better than nothing
```
**Market:** DeFi, micro-lending, wallets

---

### 10. **🤖 Anti-Bot Protection for Any Bot** ⭐⭐⭐ UNIVERSAL
**Problem:** Every popular bot gets spammed by bots
**Solution:** Add verification layer to existing bots
```
Example: Customer support bot
- Before submitting ticket → verify
- Prevents bot spam
- Reduces support load by 80%
```
**Market:** ANY popular Telegram bot

---

## 🎯 Best Pitch to Your Boss

### Option A: Gaming Focus
> "Boss, we built a sybil-resistant verification bot for Telegram. The gaming bot market alone has 50M+ users. Projects like Hamster Kombat have 300M users but struggle with bots farming rewards. Our solution: one face = one account. We can charge $0.10 per verification. At just 1M verifications/month, that's $100k MRR."

### Option B: Airdrop/Crypto Focus
> "Boss, every crypto project does airdrops, and they all get farmed by bots. We solve this with face verification. There are 1000+ new projects per year. If 100 projects use us at $5k per airdrop campaign, that's $500k annual revenue. Low competition, huge demand."

### Option C: Platform Play
> "Boss, Telegram has 900M users and 10M+ bots. We're building the 'Sign in with Mercle' for Telegram. Any bot can integrate us for anti-bot protection. Charge $0.05 per verification. If we get 1% of Telegram bots (100k bots) doing 10 verifications each = $50k MRR growing to $500k+."
